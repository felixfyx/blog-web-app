# blog-web-app
This is an attempt at creating a blog web application. It will be extremely barebones to make things easily adaptable in the future.

# Requirements
- Node.js

# Initialization steps
1. Run `npm i` to install all required packages
2. Run `node index.js`
3. Go to any browser and go to `localhost:3000`

# Note
- This blog web application will not have any persistent data kept. Some easy work around is to make use of docker and set up a container to keep some datas or something.
- This thing is purposely extremely barebones so that it's easier to look back, grab the stuff here and modify it.
